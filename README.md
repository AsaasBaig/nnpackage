# Neural Network Package (nnpackage)
Neural network package website created using Tensorflow.js with model training example using MNIST dataset.


# Landing
- Main landing with links to:
    * Deep Neural Networks page
    * Recurrent Neural Networks page [Under construction]
    * Convolutional Neural Networks page


# Running package locally?
- Download entire package
   * Run on local hosted server i.e. Python local server using `python -m http.server` in the same directory.
   * Python hosted files are accessed via `http://localhost:8000/` on any browser.
   
   
# Training using MNIST dataset
The example shown for the CNN is based off a Tensorflow.js tutorial which can also be found [Here](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/training/handwritten_digit_cnn)
