        The basis of a Neural Network becoming "Deep" stems off the basis of how artificial intelligence is; in comparison
        <br>
        to the human brain itself.

        <p class='content-header'>What is a Neuron?</p>
        <p>
            A human brain is a real life complex example of Deep Neural Networks work.
            <br><br>
            Signals in the brain are sent between neurons via synapses and depending on which neuron
            is activated by a signal, a different outcome is achieved.
            <br><br>
            A brain's neural network consists of trillions of synapses with millions of signals firing simultaneously
            to send and receive information. This allows humans to think fast and react fast.

            Image showing how a neuron's output is based on weight i.e. 0 weight for no output, 1 for output.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a similar sense, an Artificial Neural Network sends signals between nodes (Neurons) to
            provide a valued output.

        <p class='section-head'>Density and Layers</p>
        <p>
            The density of a Neural Network can usually reflect the complexity of a task being processed.
            <br>
            Depending on the task at hand, the amount of layers between an input to a Neural Network identifying a correct output can vary.

        <p class="highlighted-text">
            A realistic Dense Neural Network will consist of many connections through every layer (Hence Dense).
            <br>
            Each hidden layer neuron will have a single connection to each node in the next layer, increasing the 
            network's density.

    <section>
        <p class='section-head'>Activation</p>
        <p class='highlighted-text'>
            Activation Functions are applied upon Neurons to enable the neuron to react accordingly based on the input value
            it receives from the previous layer of neurons. 
            <br>
            An example would be neurons that are set to only output a signal if the incoming
            signal is greater than 0 of value.

            Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet) are primarily used for image recognition due to 
            its layout of neurons being efficient for pattern recognition.
            <br><br>
            An image can be identified by the human brain by identifying patterns i.e. the shape of a shoe gives away
            the fact that something is in fact a shoe.
            <br><br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="highlighted-text">
            Generally... It is easier to work with Greyscale images as that way the neural network does not have to take colour
            into account.
            <br>
            In real life situations, colour is just as important to perfectly classify an object.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is different with machine learning as we have to teach an Artificial Neural Network to 
            detect these patterns as our brain has perfected over many years of experience.
            <br><br>
            How it works is that it slices images and flattens them into matrixes of numbers, which are then
            filtered through multiple convolutional layers of neurons which will detect patterns within the slices.
            <br>
            The patterns are then processed further until an image can be formed which may fit an test output.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            This type of pattern recognition can be applied to many real life objects,
            creatures or even people to then recognise who or what something is via image patterns.
            <br><br>
            A working example with handwritten digits can be seen <a href="cnn.html">[HERE]</a>.
