          This page will highlight how Neural Networks are generally structured and why.
          <br>
          (With examples of different NN structures)
      </p>
      <p>
        The basis of a Neural Network becoming "Deep" stems off the basis of how artificial intelligence is; in comparison
        <br>
        to the human brain itself.

        <p class='section-head'>What is a neuron?</p>
        <p>
            Simply put, a human brain is a real life complex example of Deep Neural Networks work.
            <br><br>
            Signals in the brain are sent between neurons via synapses and depending on which neuron
            is activated by a signal, a different outcome is achieved.
            <br><br>
            A brain's neural network consists of trillions of synapses with millions of signals firing simultaneously
            to send and receive information. This allows humans to think fast and react fast.

            Image showing how a neuron's output is based on weight i.e. 0 weight for no output, 1 for output.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a similar sense, an Artificial Neural Network sends signals between nodes (Neurons) to
            provide a valued output.

        <p class='section-head'>Density and Layers</p>
        <p>
            The density of a Neural Network can usually reflect the complexity of a task being processed.
            <br>
            Depending on the task at hand, the amount of layers between an input to a Neural Network identifying a correct output can vary.

        <p>
            Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet) are primarily used for image recognition due to 
            its layout of neurons being efficient for pattern recognition.
            <br><br>
            An image can be identified by the human brain by identifying patterns i.e. the shape of a shoe gives away
            the fact that something is in fact a shoe.
            <br><br><br>

        <p>
            This is different with machine learning as we have to teach an Artificial Neural Network to 
            detect these patterns as our brain has perfected over many years of experience.
            <br><br>
            How it works is that it slices images and flattens them into matrixes of numbers, which are then
            filtered through multiple convolutional layers of neurons to detect patterns.
            <br>
            Generally... It is easier to work with Greyscale images as that way the neural network does not have to take colour
            into account. 
            <br>
            In real life situations, colour is just as important to perfectly classify an object.
            <br><br>
            This can apply to many real life objects, creatures or even people to recognise who or what something is based on an image.
            <br><br>
